# 34B Authentication & OAuth

You have two main tasks for this workshop:

1. Use `bcrypt` to encrypt user passwords. Only encrypted passwords should be stored in the database. When a user tries to log in, compare the password they provide with what's stored in the database.

2. _Add_ the option for users to authenticate via Github OAuth. They should still have the ability to register and login with a username and password.

The [Github documentation on building OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps) will be very useful to reference.

## Suggestions

Here are some suggestions for what to work on:

- Frontend components are updated to signify the "Login via Github" option.
- A Github OAuth app has been created with a client id and secret.
- A redirect route has been added to the backend to receive the authorization code from Github.
- The backend is able to make requests to Github on behalf of a user by sending an access token.
- The account for a user logged in via Github is created and stored in the database.
- The client still receives a token from the server after a user is successfully authenticated, _regardless_ of whether the user logged in via Github or username/password.
