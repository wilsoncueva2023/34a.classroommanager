# 34C Backend Testing

For this workshop, your task is to add test suites to the backend. These tests do not need to be comprehensive, but try your best to test as many different situations as possible!

Refer to [the Prisma documentation on testing](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/testing/unit-testing#example-unit-tests) and [the SuperTest documentation](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest) as you work on this workshop.

## Suggestions

Here are some suggestions for what to work on:

- Use SuperTest to test each Express endpoint.
- Test authentication; i.e. an instructor with id 4 cannot perform any CRUD operation on the students of the instructor with id 5.

## Extensions

If you have fully completed the tasks for 34A, 34B, and 34C, congrats! That's awesome! Here are some suggestions for additional features that you can work on for practice:

- testing the Express endpoints with mocked data
- unit testing Prisma Client operations
- writing test suites for the frontend
- using a component library or writing CSS to make the frontend look nice
- add form validation to the frontend
- adding another OAuth provider
